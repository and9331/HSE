## Final project
During the course we have covered a lot of topics like internet marketing and metrics, categorisation and airfare aggregators, some data science basics, Masterchef cooking competition, and so on. You might have been interested in one topic or another, but there is a particular topic that makes us all happy. I mean, games! We play games in different ages, and some of us even devote their career to become professional gamers. Since the fact that 40% of the Earth population play games, there is no surprise that Python - as a multi-purpose programming language - does its best to satisfy the needs of gamers and developers of computer games.

This time I didn't scroll towardsdatascience.com, so there will be no link to it, but I found my inspiration in another source. Free Python Games is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python games intended for education and fun. The games are written in simple Python code and designed for experimentation and changes. Simplified versions of several classic arcade games are included.

Assignment Instructions: an Example of a Game

Imagine a simple game, where you have a hero and a monster. The idea of the game is simple - a hero moves on a field and collects inventory - which affects hero's HP and power - until he/she meets a monster. Then, a fight starts. A hero can either attack a monster or defend. A hero can use special combinations, which determine damage done to a monster. A monster attacks a hero with a constant damage during a fight. As a result, a hero either wins or loses. Hence, the following actions should be transformed into Python functions:

- To create a hero with different characteristics. i.e. to create a function that allows you to create a hero and set parameters for it;

- To make a hero to be able to move around the location;

- To make a hero to be able to collect inventory (and to display collected inventory on a screen);

- To attack a monster;

- To defend;

- To generate a set of combinations to attack a monster;

- To adapt all the functions to either easy or hard modes;

- etc. ...

Step-by-step Instructions

In this assignment we want you to use all of the information available in this course and work on a simple game in Python.You can either choose / come up with a simple game OR use the example of a simple game above to complete this assignment. In both scenarios we expect you to follow these simple guidelines. Read them carefully and thoroughly!

First of all, describe a game you are working on. The description should include its name, the very idea of a game, rules of the game, description of win/lose scenarios (e.g. a snake dies by either (a) running into the edge of the board, or (b) by running into its own tail), and whatever things you need to add to make sure that a reader understands the idea of your game. Keep in mind that you can either choose an existing game or come up with a new one, but you anyway have to provide us with a thorough description of the game you chose.

Based on the description, develop a set of actions which you will then translate into a Python programming code. For instance, Snake game consists of such actions as "change snake direction", "eat apple", "move forward". Use human language, not a programming one.

Write functions for your game to make it work! Remember that one function should be responsible for only one action. Besides that, write some of your functions in a way that they support different modes (e.g. easy, normal, and hard). Do not overthink this part of the assignment! The bare minimum to get a good grade for the assignment is to write 6-12 functions which perform particular actions in a game.

Optional: test your game. Show how the game works if it's possible. For instance, use turtle or much easier ways to show how the game works. Again, it's optional.

Complete the task in Jupyter Notebook. Insert the programming code in code cells and text explanations in markdown cells. Make sure that you name your file appropriately (e.g. Final_Game_[your surname].ipynb).
