Both hero and monster have stats, such as HP (a quantitative measure of \"life\"), damage (amount of the opponent's HP to be subtracted after the successful attack). Also, the hero has a defense number. It means when the hero is in defense positions, the amount of this parameter would be subtracted from the monster damage to the hero. If it's more, than monster damage, nothing happens, and the monster can't do any damage to the hero."

Also, it tracks the current game state if it hasn't started yet or finished already. Print the welcome screen with all the buttons and options, but also the final win or lose message. Basically, it is the control center for the whole game. The one that holds all the other classes together."

        "Many features of this game are based on the classes and methods provided by the PyGame library. For example, hero, monster, and even the arrows or bottles objects are inherited from Sprite class of the PyGame module. This way, all the work to represent it on the screen and check the collisions is up to the module itself. And the work here includes only developing the program logic itself, writing a set of class methods, and processing interactions between different parts of the game. In terms of the current final project conditions specified in the evaluation criteria, the classes methods represent the implementation of a functions, which are needed to successfully pass the final project check."

Other buttons take effect when they are clicked by the mouse cursor. The last button that was clicked is considered the final choice for a certain option (difficulty or hero class)."

The hero could be controlled by arrow keys on the keyboard in any of four directions from edge to edge of the screen. Also, the hero automatically collects up to three unused bottles, which could be used by the specified keys: 'H' - for the health bottle (red), 'A' - for the damage bottle (blue), and 'D' - for the defense bottle (yellow). The space bar is used to attack the monster by the hero. Warrior class could only do damage to the monster if they collided. Archer in turn, could make up to three arrows on the gamefield at the same time. Arrows moving from the left to the right of the screen do damage to the monster if they collide. Arrows would disappear in that case, or when reaching the far right border of the screen. When the arrow disappeared, the archer could shoot another one."

        "Due to limitations of either Google Colab or a local Jupyter notebook. The example of the game described above is provided in a separate file called 'final_proj_branov.py'. In order for this game to work, it is extremely necessary to have the PyGame module installed; version 2.4.0 is recommended. Also, the images for the game object sprites must be inside the \"images\" catalog in the same directory as the main .py file of the program. For this project, I'll try to attach the current .ipynb, .py  file and images of the game program in the form of .zip archive or/and separately. To execute the program, it is enough to execute 'python ./final_proj_baranov.py' command in the terminal or the command line in the graphical interface of the OS (e.g. Windows)."
