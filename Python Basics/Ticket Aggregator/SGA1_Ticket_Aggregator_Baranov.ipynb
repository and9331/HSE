    "The program is designed to classify an airfare offer based on the criteria provided in the user input. Specifically user inputs the *ticket price*, *number of transfers*, *refund* and *luggage* policy. Each parameter has it's rules, e.g. price can be only integer or float number, transfers number either natural number or zero, refund and luggage included is 'y' for yes or 'n' for no. The values typed into fields are controlled, the program will ask to repeat input if the value is not what has been expected. Some parameters have default values to ease inputs and testing.\n",

    "*   \"**Good enough**\". Price from \\$200 to \\$250, less than 2 transfers, refund and luggage don't matter\n",
    "*   \"**The worst offer**\". Price is more than \\$250, 3 or more transfers, refund and luggage don't matter\n",

    "*Processing user inputs*. The program takes user inputs and uses a while loops to ensure that the user provides the expected input or stops the program. In the case of the ticket price, the input can be a natural or float number. Therefore, a ValueError try-except block is used to catch the situation where the input cannot be converted to float. In addition, the price cannot be negative number *(let us assume zero is for situations where ticket is free)*. For the number of transfers, only digits are expected. For refund and luggage, either 'y' or 'n' can be entered. Once the parameters are received as expected, the program casts the transfer number to an integer and the 'y' or 'n' answers to 1 or 0 type integers. This way, the last two parameters can be used directly as Boolean values.  Additionally, all three parameters have default values."

    "<p>Ticket aggregator of such implementation is hardly can be exact, but it still provides an example of how the simplest classification algorithms could work. My opinion there's a place for improvements. For example, the price ranges may be different due to inflation and currency exchange rates. Also some other parameters could be included in input for evaluations (e.g. flight duration). It's possible to add new flight offer categories such as the \"Cheapest\" (let's assume price < 150 and luggage and return policies don't matter), or the \"Fastest\" based on possibly added \"flight duration\" metric, or \"convenient\" with no transfers and \"best value\" for the price range with luggage and refund included.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>In any case, all those categories are meaningful only if we compare currently inspected offer to the significant amount of other different ones. So that's all just theoretical situation on the topic of how the specific solution could be improved.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The best known professional decision is to add machine learning algorithms to the solution. But for this purpose first the one must accumulate a significant amount of different flight offers records, which include much more parameters than in user inputs in previous solution. Those records will provide data for a subsequent analysis, afterward the one can decide which parameters are important and which can be dropped. Thereafter, the chosen ML algorithm could be trained upon that data with supervised learning (if already known which offer categories corresponds to our records), or with unsupervised learning (if give the classification making to the algorithm). But this theme is a bit outside of the current task topic.</p>"

    "<p>Other possible solution could include scikit-learn library and some machine learning algorithms from it for the multi-label classification or keras/tensorflow solutions. However, to be able to use considered tools there is must be prepared dataset with the parameters (such as price, duration, policies and transfers). In terms of the provided task it's not possible to fully complete the machine learning solution correct way. That's why I decided not to include that improvement in my alternative ticket aggregator implementation. </p>\n",

    "<p>Still the example illustrates the use of functions, if-elif conditions and provides proper user input checking. It's still has some flows and could be re-made once more. The main problem here, that's all the criteria in the task and those which I proposed, are all extremely subjective. They are not based on the research or data analysis, and seems quite theoretical. Therefore, making a correct ticket aggregator is non-easy task, which takes lot's of effort, including data accumulation or extraction, exploration, processing and afterwards using it either way for proper classification.</p>"
