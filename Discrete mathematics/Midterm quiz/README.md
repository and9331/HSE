Midterm Quiz

1.
Can it be that |A|=5
, |B|=3
 and |A∪B|=6
? If it is possible, provide an example, otherwise provide a proof that this is impossible.

2.
Can it be that |A|=5
 , |B|=3
 , |A∪B|=6
 and |A∩B|=1
? If it is possible, provide an example, otherwise provide a proof that this is impossible.

3.
Check whether the following equivalence on sets holds by considering elements of each side and checking whether they are contained in the other side:

(A∪B)∖C=(A∖C)∪(B∖C)


4.
Suppose mobile company has 6 mobile plans. They make a survey among their clients asking for the client’s favorite mobile plan, second favorite plan (that should be different from the first one) and the most overpriced mobile plan in client’s opinion (that can be the same as his two favorite plans, or can be some other plan). What is the number of possible different outcomes of the survey? Provide a detailed explanation of your calculation. If you are using some of the rules (including the rule of sum and the rule of product), please explain why are you using these rules.

5.

Suppose mortgage company has 10 houses. They want to calculate distance between each two (distinct) houses among them (just usual distance on the map). We want to count how many distances we will calculate. What is wrong with the following solution attempt? Explain the mistake and provide a correct answer to the problem.

Solution attempt: We need to count the number of pairs of houses. The first house can be picked in 10 ways. The second house can be picked in 9 possible ways, since one of the houses was already picked. By the rule of product the pairs of houses can be picked in 10 \times 9 = 90 possible ways. So we will need to make 90 calculations.

6.
How many ways are there to write down numbers from 0 to 9 in a sequence in such a way that even numbers are positioned in the sequence in the increasing order and odd numbers are positioned in the decreasing order? Provide a detailed explanation for your solution.

7.
L​et A
 and B
 be events associated with some random experiment. Is it possible that these events never occur simultaneously and P(A)=1/2
, P(B)=1/3
? If yes, give an example of random experiment and events that satisfy these conditions. If no, give a proof.

8.

T​here is a small village with only ten adult people living in it. Instead of elections, they form their "government" using random choice. Every adult villager has equal probability to be chosen. Consider two random experiments:

1​. The villagers want to select a Village Council that consists of three persons. The researcher is interested in the list of members of one Council.

2​. Every four months villagers select a President. The same person can be President arbitrary number of times. The same person can be a President and a member of Village Council at the same time. The researcher is interested in the ordered list of Presidents during one year.

D​escribe the sample spaces (sets of all elementary outcomes) for both experiments. Use the corresponding notions from combinatorics. Find the number of elements in both sample spaces. Provide all calculations and detailed explanations. What is the difference between these experiments?

9.
C​onsider the following random experiment. We roll two identical indistinguishable symmetric dices once and record the result of this tossing (i.e. "on one dice we obtained 1 and on another we obtained 2").

Describe sample space (set of all outcomes) of this experiment. What is the probability of event "on one dice we obtained 1 and on another we obtained 2"? What is the probability of event "we obtained two 1's"? What kind of sample space you consider in this problem: sample space with equal probabilities of outcomes or sample space with non-equal probabilities of outcomes? Explain your answer.
