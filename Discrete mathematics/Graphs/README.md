## Graphs
Provide detailed answers to the questions below. All statements should be provided with proofs. The format of submission is free: you can either typeset your answers in LaTeX / MS Word and submit the resulting files for each task (.pdf, .docx, .tex, ... - PDF preferred), or submit a scan or photos of handwritten answers. In the latter case, the scan or photos should be clearly readable.



1. In a country there are several airports. Airport A is directly connected to 23 other airports. Airport B has a direct connection to 3 other airports. Each airport, except A and B, is directly connected to 10 other airports. Prove that there is an airline route (maybe with flight changes) between A and B.

2. Consider an Erdős–Rényi random graph on 4 vertices with p=1/2. Calculate the probability that this graph is connected.

3. Which of the following pictures can be drawn in one stroke of pen, without traversing a line twice (like a Euler path in a graph)?

4. Does there exist a graph with 5 vertices which have the following degrees: 2, 4, 4, 4, 4?

5. A connected graph on 10 vertices has 15 edges. What is the maximal number of edges one can remove so that the graph remains connected? Note that if your answer is N, then you need to explain that:

- after removing some N edges from any connected graph on 10 vertices with 15 edges the resulting graph remains connected;

- there exists a connected graph on 10 vertices with 15 edges such that after removing any (N + 1) edges it becomes disconnected.

6. A graph on 6 vertices has 11 edges. Prove that this graph is connected.

7. A graph on 10 vertices has 3 isolated vertices (degree 0) and 7 vertices of degree 2. Could such a graph be bipartite? How many vertices are there in an optimal vertex cover for this graph? (Consider all possible cases.)
